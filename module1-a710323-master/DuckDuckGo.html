        The following is the regrade policy for CSE330/CSE503.
    </h2>
    <h3>
        It must be objectively clear that an error was made during grading. <br/>
        Examples of such errors include a grader incorrectly summing points or incorrectly marking something not completed. <br/>
        Grades based on the judgement of the grader, except in extremely extenuating circumstances, will not be regraded. <br/>
        In particular, grades for categories like "Site is Visually Appealing" will not be regraded. <br/>
        All regrade requests must be submitted by email to cse330ta@gmail.com within one week of grading. <br/>
        Requests submitted after this deadline will not be considered. <br/>
        Requests must contain a specific explanation of the error, including filenames and line numbers of code, if appropriate.<br/>
